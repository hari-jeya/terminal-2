  hello 👋,
  welcome to my web site 🤝
  
  my name is Hariharan JEYAKRISHNAN but bring my maths teacher everyone Hari,
  so I invite you to do the same unless you are Mr.Snape. 😬
  
  I am a student in computer science specialized in cybersecurity. Moreover I am a very big fan of linux 🐧
  and opensource in general.👨🏼‍💻
  so to share my love for linux i decided to create this site which looks like a terminal, not only in appearance ;)
  

  the inspiration comes from when I was doing the Mr.robot show at Try Hack Me where
  they had a terminal website to hack and in my head the light bulb went straight on. 💡
  
  don't hesitate to try the commands on my site and tell me what you think :D`;
