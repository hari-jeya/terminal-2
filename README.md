# WELCOME
![image showing the homepage of the site.](/assets/docs/site.png)

Hello, welcome to the repo of my website.
I co-built this site because like many of you I'm a big fan of the Linux and Open source world.

I wanted to share my love for linux through this site which not only looks like a linux terminal but also has some functionality.

# Origins

I did not build the site from scratch, this project is fork of the absolutely brilliant repo of [Yassine Fathi](https://github.com/m4tt72)

feel free to check his repo [here](https://github.com/m4tt72/terminal).

# Forked
If you want to build a terminal site you can of course fork my repo.

but I advise you to fork Yassine Fathi's repo because his repo must be better maintained than mine.

if need be, don't hesitate to CTRL+C; CTRL+V the modifications I made to the project.
